        <p className="paragraph">Dear Student,</p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          It’s wonderful to see you visiting your alma mater’s alumni website. I hope it brings back fond
          memories of some of the best years of your life. That’s why I’ve chosen to address you as
          ‘student’ rather than ‘alumnus’ - because that’s who you were then, and in many ways, who you
          will always be to us. </p>
          <p className="paragraph">  I’m sure you’ve been keeping up with IIT Palakkad’s growth and staying in touch with your
favorite teachers and staff. If not, why not surprise them with an email today? I assure you, it will
make their day. And when you get the chance, do visit the campus. Your classrooms, hostels,
          grounds, and favorite hangout spots are always open to you.</p>
          <p className="paragraph">
You can also engage more actively with our current students - your juniors - by sharing stories
about life after graduation, offering advice on making the most of campus life, and imparting
insights on what truly matters in life. If you have a story to tell, we would love to hear it! Please
reach out to the IAR Cell or Alumni Relations Office. You can also take the engagement further
          and mentor a few of our students whose aspirations resonate with yours.</p>
          <p className="paragraph">
On a more formal note, keeping your profile updated with our Alumni Relations Office helps us
stay connected. Your achievements give meaning to the work we do, and we take immense
pride in celebrating them.  </p>
<p className="paragraph">Looking forward to hearing from you,</p>
          {/* <p className="paragraph">Congratulations on your graduation! I can only imagine the melange of emotions - pride, satisfaction, relief, joy, nostalgia and what not - that each one of you is experiencing at this special moment in your life. While a small part of me is sad to bid you farewell, a larger part of me is happy and proud to have contributed to nurturing you into wonderful human beings during your time at IIT Palakkad. I&apos;m sure every faculty and staff member of the Institute is feeling the same.</p>
          <p className="paragraph">Speaking for the Students&apos; Section which oversees the accommodation, sports, extracurriculars and wellness of the students, we believe you got every opportunity to pursue your interests - both old and newfound. Yes there was Covid, there was campus shifting, some sports facilities were just getting built. But we believe you could make the best use of your time on campus. Most importantly, we hope that you have made friends and memories that will last a lifetime.</p>
          <p className="paragraph">I would also like to thank you. Thank you for organising many student-led activities, volunteering for many more activities, for bringing many laurels to our Institute, for graciously adjusting to our infrastructural limitations, for spreading joy throughout the campus and for keeping all of us always young.</p>
          <p className="paragraph">If you are reading this in 2024, let me conclude by wishing you a bright future and requesting you to always keep in touch with the Institute. If you are reading it much later, let me also urge you to think of ways in which you can contribute to your alma mater using the vast experience and resources you would have gathered on your way. </p> */}
